    <p>
      Since November 2022, I have been a PhD student in Engineering and Information Science
      at the University of Siena.
    </p>

    <p>
      I received the Master's degree with Honours in Applied Mathematics from the University
      of Siena in 2022, with a thesis entitled
      <em>"Combinatorial and discrete differential operators for the study of β-sheets"</em>,
      supervised by Professor Cristiano Bocci.
      I obtained the Bachelor's Degree with Honours in Mathematics from the University of Siena,
      with a thesis on <em>"Logical Operators and Neural Networks"</em> under the supervision
      of Professor Luca Chiantini.

Research 
======
My research lies at the intersection of Algebraic Geometry and Tensor methods, with a focus on notions of tensor rank and border rank, and their applications to complexity theory and networks.
