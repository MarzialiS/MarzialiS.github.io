I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the University of Siena.

My research lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and tensor methods,
with a focus on notions of tensor rank and border rank, and their applications
to complexity theory and algebraic models of networks.

During my PhD, I worked on algebraic approaches to network representations,
tensor products and invariants, and on interactions between algebra,
machine learning, and applications to biology.

I have been a visiting researcher at Auburn University and at the Institut de
Mathématiques de Toulouse.

I am interested in postdoctoral opportunities starting Fall 2026.
