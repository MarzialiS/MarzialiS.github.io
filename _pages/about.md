Since November 2022, I have been a PhD student in Engineering and Information Science at the University of Siena.



I received the Master's degree with Honours in Applied Mathematics from the University of Siena in 2022, with a thesis entitled "Combinatorial and discrete differential operators for the study of β-sheets", supervised by Professor Cristiano Bocci. I obtained the Bachelor's Degree with Honours in Mathematics from the University of Siena, with a thesis on "Logical Operators and Neural Networks" under the supervision of Professor Luca Chiantini.


Research 
======
My research lies at the intersection of Algebraic Geometry and Tensor methods, with a focus on notions of tensor rank and border rank, and their applications to complexity theory and networks.
