My research lies in algebraic geometry and multilinear algebra, with a focus on
tensor methods and rank notions, and their interactions with complexity theory,
network models, and applications.

A recurring theme of my work is the use of algebraic and geometric tools to
understand how structural properties of tensors reflect computational,
combinatorial, and network phenomena.

## Tensor methods and rank notions

A central part of my research concerns tensor rank and border rank, both from a
structural and an asymptotic point of view. I am interested in how different
rank notions capture intrinsic complexity properties of multilinear maps, with
particular attention to matrix multiplication tensors and related problems in
algebraic complexity theory.

In this direction, I have worked on border-rank decompositions and on algebraic
approaches to approximate algorithms, combining theoretical tools with
computational experiments.

## Algebraic models of networks and tensor products

Another main research line focuses on algebraic descriptions of networks through
tensorial constructions. I study how directed acyclic graphs and more general
network structures can be encoded by tensors, and how network behavior can be
described via tensor products and invariants.

In particular, I have investigated the Bhattacharya–Mesner product as a natural
multilinear operation for modeling signal propagation in networks. This approach
leads to a global tensor associated with the network, whose algebraic properties
reflect structural features of the underlying graph. I am especially interested
in inverse problems and identifiability questions arising from this framework.

## Interactions with complexity theory, machine learning, and applications

I am interested in connections between algebraic methods and modern applications,
including machine learning and computational biology. My work includes the use
of algebraic and geometric tools to analyze neural-network–type models, model
explainability techniques, and biological data representations.

These interactions motivate new algebraic questions, particularly concerning
tensor invariants, identifiability, and complexity measures, and provide a
testing ground for theoretical developments.

## Future directions

My future research aims to further explore the role of tensorial and geometric
methods in complexity theory and network analysis, with an emphasis on rank and
subrank phenomena, asymptotic behavior, and algebraic characterizations of
computational models.
